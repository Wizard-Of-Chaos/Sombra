This generates an A* pathfinding algorithm. It finds a path through an ASCII map of '.', '#' from S to F.

At compilation time it generates two different executables, Manhattan and Euclidean.
The program runs a different heuristic from the same file based off which of the two is being run.

To run it:
./Euclidean map.txt

Or:
./Manhattan map.txt
